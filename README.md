# Pandas-Learnings
1. The most powerful, fast, flexible and easy to use open source data analytics and manipulation tool.  
2. Two most frequently used datatypes in pandas are "series and dataframe.  
3. A pandas series is like a column in a table (1-d array holding any datatype). 
4. When we have to create series from a table earlier we had (squeeze=True) but its not supported everywhere so we instead use indexing subs=subs[:,0].  
5. Pandas does not use : slicing like NumPy arrays directly with labels. You need .loc (label-based indexing) or .iloc (integer position indexing).
